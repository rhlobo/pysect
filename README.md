_Security related scripts and tools, implemented for fun_

This projects aims to help me have fun, creating a demand for myself practing and refreshing some networking concepts. For now - and probably a long time - it will not be handled as a serios project: do not expect continuation.


### Backlog - Ideas

- Create APR poisoning tool
- Implement sslstrip features
- Integrate with mitm-proxy
-- Record traffic
-- Change traffic
-- Monitor traffic
--- Save passwords for known services
--- Save cookie / header information
- Highjack sessions
- Create DNS spoofing tool
- Create fake web app servers
-- Save logged passwords
--- Save cookie / header information

__IMPORTANT__: I cannot assure what (and when) I will end implemented.
